# Conduit — Implementation Plan

Last updated: 2026-05-26

## Vision

Conduit is the hub for the personal app ecosystem (circuit / canopy / chef). It serves two roles:

1. **Terminal UI** — interactive, question-driven chat: "What are my tasks today?", "Who should I assign this to?", "What should I cook?"
2. **Diary UI** — input-driven capture: "Here's what I did today..." → parsed and silently routed to individual apps.

The same terminal-like shell is also embedded inside each sibling app for context-specific chat.

---

## Status

### ✅ Implemented

#### Conduit backend
- `POST /api/chat` — direct Groq streaming
- `POST /api/agent/chat` — tool-calling agent mode (with optional `diary: true` flag)
- `GET /api/models`
- Full auth layer (local users + Cortex fallback)
- Chat history save/load

#### Agent mode — read tools (all wired, all tested)
| Tool | Source | What it fetches |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `get_my_tasks` | circuit `/api/tasks` | pending/completed tasks with priority, effort, tag |
| `get_task_summary` | circuit `/api/summary` | totals, completion rate, breakdown by tag |
| `get_people` | canopy `/api/people` | people list with optional name search |
| `get_recent_interactions` | canopy `/api/interactions` | recent interactions, filterable by person/tag |
| `get_meal_recommendation` | chef `/recipes/recommend` | recipe recommendations |
| `get_cook_vs_order` | chef `/decision/cook-vs-order` | cook-vs-order decision with reasoning |
| `get_food_log` | chef `/history` | today's meal log |

#### Diary mode — write tools (all wired)
| Tool | Destination | What it writes |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `create_task` | circuit `POST /api/tasks` | new task with tag, effort, urgency, importance |
| `log_interaction` | canopy `POST /api/interactions` | interaction with participant name resolution |
| `log_meal` | chef `POST /history` | meal decision with cuisine, satisfaction |

#### Frontend
- Three chat modes: `chat` / `agent` / `diary` (persisted to localStorage)
- AgentToggle + DiaryToggle buttons in topbar
- Slash commands: `/help`, `/chat`, `/agent`, `/diary`, `/model`, `/system`, `/clear`, `/logout`, `/models`
- `/digest` command: fetches daily briefing from all three apps
- Diary mode: suppresses AI response, shows confirmation summary (`✓ circuit create_task × 2`)
- PWA installable, deployed on GitHub Pages + Render
- WebAuthn passkey / biometric sign-in (`usePasskey` hook, `PasskeyBanner` post-login prompt)

---

### ✅ Implemented (Phase A — bug fixes, 2026-05-26)

- **`/digest` routing bug fixed** — digest block now runs before the slash guard in `TerminalShell.tsx`
- **CORS expanded** — conduit backend now allows localhost `:3002`, `:3003`, `:3004` for sibling app dev servers
- **`scope` param added** to `/api/agent/chat` — restricts tools to circuit / canopy / chef subsets; drives scoped system prompts

### ✅ Implemented (Phase B — diary UI, 2026-05-26)

- **`DiaryCompose` component** — dedicated multi-line compose area replacing the single-line `CommandInput` when diary mode is active
- Large textarea (min 120px), date header, Ctrl+Enter to save, Esc to clear, `[save]` button
- `TerminalShell` now renders `DiaryCompose` vs `CommandInput` based on `chatMode`

### ✅ Implemented (Phase C — terminal UI in sibling apps, 2026-05-26)

- **`TerminalChat` component** added to circuit, canopy, chef
  - Full-screen terminal overlay (`position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 100`)
  - Phosphor green-on-black theme matching conduit
  - Calls conduit's `/api/agent/chat` with `scope=<app>`
  - Uses each app's own auth token as `sibling_token`
  - Configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONDUIT_API_URL` env var (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
- **`/chat` page** added to circuit, canopy, chef
- **Nav updated** — "Chat" added to circuit nav, canopy sidebar + keyboard shortcut `5`, chef sidebar + bottom tabs
- **`SCOPE_TOOLS` mapping** in conduit definitions.py — scoped tool subsets per app
- **Per-scope system prompts** in conduit agent_service.py

---

### 🐛 Remaining known issues

#### 1. Sibling app auth in production
Conduit passes `conduit_auth_token` as the `sibling_token` to circuit/canopy/chef. In development this may work if the apps share the same Cortex instance. In production (Render), each app needs to accept the same token, which requires:
- A shared Cortex-based token validation in circuit/canopy/chef, OR
- Conduit to pass credentials and receive per-app tokens (not yet designed)

#### 2. Sibling URLs are hardcoded to localhost
**File:** `backend/app/config.py`  
`circuit_url = "http://localhost:8001"` etc. — will fail on Render unless overridden via env vars. Need `CIRCUIT_URL`, `CANOPY_URL`, `CHEF_URL` env vars set on the Render dashboard.

### ⬜ Future work

#### Phase D — Additional write tools
Currently only three write tools exist. Missing:
- `update_task` — mark a task complete, change effort/urgency (circuit `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}`)
- `create_person` — add a new contact in Canopy (canopy `POST /api/people`)
- `get_interactions_for_person` — already in executor but could use a dedicated tool with person resolution by name
- `update_meal_entry` — correct a logged meal (chef `PATCH /history/{id}`)

## Architecture Reference

```
conduit (hub)
│   POST /api/agent/chat
│   tools: [read × 7, write × 3]
│
├── circuit  :8001  tasks, summary, search
├── canopy   :8002  people, interactions
└── chef     :8003  recipes, decisions, history
```

Auth flow:  
`conduit_auth_token` (JWT) → Conduit validates → passes as Bearer to sibling apps → sibling apps validate via same Cortex instance.

## Decision Log

- **Groq-only backend**: MVP uses Groq; multi-provider (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Ollama) is a later phase
- **Diary mode suppresses AI response**: confirmed design — only a structured confirmation is shown, not a full model reply
- **Conduit as orchestrator only**: circuit/canopy/chef have no inter-app calls; all coordination goes through conduit
- **Terminal-first UI**: no rounded cards, no icons, JetBrains Mono everywhere, phosphor theme only
- **Single theme (phosphor)**: terminal/light theme removed; Dancing Script replaces Caveat for diary handwriting font
